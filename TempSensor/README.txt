Description:
	This program creates 10 temperature datapoints and saves them to temperature_readings.txt file.
	
	At main interface level the user can choose to take measurements, print out the datapoints or end the program.
	
	After the user has chosen to take measurements, the user can save the results to .txt file or take a new set of data.
	
	If the user wants to print out measurements when no datapoints has been previously saved, the user is informed that there is no .txt file to be read.
